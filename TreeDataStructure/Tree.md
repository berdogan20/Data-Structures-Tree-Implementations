		 * A tree consists of a root, and zero or more subtrees T1, T2, â€¦ , 
		 * Tk such that there is an edge from the root of the tree to the root of each subtree.
		 * The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e, they are not stored linearly. 
		 * Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or we can say it is a hierarchical structure. 
		 * 
		 * Tree Terminology
		 * root
		 * internal node
		 * external node / leaf
		 * ancestors of a node
		 * depth of a node
		 * height of a tree
		 * descendant of a node
		 * subtree
		 * edge
		 * path
		 * ordered tree
		 * 
		 * Types of Tree data structures
		 * 1. General tree
		 * 		A general tree data structure has no restriction on the number of nodes. 
		 * 		It means that a parent node can have any number of child nodes.  
		 * 2. Binary tree
		 * 		A node of a binary tree can have a maximum of two child nodes. 
		 * 3. Balanced Tree
		 * 		If the height of the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree is equal 
		 * 		or differs at most by 1, the tree is known as a balanced tree.  
		 * 4. Binary Search Tree
		 * 		It is a non-linear data structure. It shows that the value of the left node 
		 * 		is less than its parent, while the value of the right node is greater than its parent.

		 * Advantages of Tree data structure
		 	Efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
			Trees are flexibility in terms of the types of data that can be stored.
			It is used to represent hierarchical relationships.
			It has the ability to represent a recursive structure.
			Used in various algorithms and data structures such as Huffman coding and decision trees.
			Trees use less space than other data structures, like lists, and linked lists.
			Trees are dynamic in nature.
			Tree data structures can automatically self-organize as new data is added or removed, which can improve performance and reduce complexity.
		 * Disadvantages of Tree data structure
		  	Trees require additional memory for pointers.
			Trees are not the best choice for data that does not have hierarchical relationships.
			Trees with many levels can become expensive to search and traverse.
			Limited scalability compared to other data structures such as hash tables.
			Trees are typically used for storing and manipulating hierarchical data, and may not be the best choice for other types of data.
			Not suitable for large datasets.
			Trees can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance and decreased efficiency.
